      <h1>Pratik Chaudhari</h1>
      <p> Engineer with a big interest in big data and app development</p>

    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 space">
      <p>My name is Pratik Gajanan Chaudhari, and I am currently a sophomore studying mechanical engineering and computer science at UIUC. When I started college, I was solely interested in mechanical engineering, and hence started off with that as my major. However, ever since the second half of freshman year, I have been slowly drawn to computer science. Despite that, what I want to do hasn't changed at all. I want to develop and engineer products in order to bring positive change in the world, may they be virtual or physical.</p>
      <p>I started out solely as a mechanical engineering major very interested in cars, and participated in Eco-Illini, which was a formula SAE team. We made a car that ran at almost 1000 miles per gallon! I had worked on the engine and electrics team simultaneously. More specifically, I wrote a little bit of code for some sensors, and help integrate them into engine of the car. That little bit of coding, however, is what got me into computer science. I was taking an introductory computer science course for engineers at the time, and fell in love with the idea of developing something virtual that could reach millions of people.</p>
      <p>Ever since, I started taking a lot of CS courses intended for computer science majors at my university. I am currently taking part in an honors course at my university, and developing an app that determines the efficiency of birth control as a part of it. I also work on a bunch of scripts and scrapers on the side. I ended up having to write a python script to tell me when seats for a CS class opened up, just due to the sheer demand of the CS courses at UIUC!
      All my projects are listed on the main page, if you are interested in looking at them. That's all about me though. If you have reached this part of the website, that means you've perused basically about everything, so thank you! <a href = "https://i.redd.it/17ot3u5q5s101.jpg">Here is a treat for you.</a></p></div>
